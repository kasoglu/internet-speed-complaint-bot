# Installing
Download the [Python 3](https://python.org) installer package from the official website and install it, if not installed previously.

* Run the following in the terminal to install the modules to run your program without excussions.
```
pip install selenium
```

Also to use this bot, you should download and install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) web browser and [Chrome Web Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) here.

# How to Use?

Download the source code from the repository and run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file.
```
python3 main.py
```

* Note! For the code to work you need to replace all the placeholders with your own details. e.g. ```CHROME_DRIVER_PATH```, ```TWITTER_USERNAME```,```TWITTER_PASSWORD```,.

Follow these instructions below.

In order to tweet at an internet provider, we of course need a twitter account. If you want, you can set up a new Twitter account instead of using your personal account.

1. Sign up for a Twitter account here:

2. Additionally, you'll need to get your Internet Service Provider (ISP)'s guaranteed internet speeds. This should be in your contract somewhere. Alternatively, you could just use an example speed, e.g. 150Mbps download, 10Mbps upload. Replace it on the file.


**NOTE: If you are logging into Twitter repeatedly, they will make you complete a Re-CAPTCHA/send a confirmation code to your email to prove you are human. Go through this process to continue testing.**
